# Garry's Mod Loading Screen
This is a loading screen created for a game called Garry's Mod.
You can freely use this loading screen for your own server.

## Why make another loading screen?

Well, I know there are a lot of other free and even better loading screens provided by the community, but I wanted something new and unique for my community and to learn and advance my own programming and web development skills.

### How to use

Just drag and drop the files into your webserver and change the "MistyNetwork" text to your network name 


### Planned features

#### Already started but unfinished:

 Admin Panel with in-game tips control
